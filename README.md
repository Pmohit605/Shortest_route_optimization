# Shortest_route_optimization
Generation of matrix based output and scalable with dimensions, Additional Heuristic value, making it more efficient for real world
How to run ?
1) Download the cpp file and run it , 
2) Set matrix dimension inaccordance to requirments
3) Input the environment
4) Most feasible ouput will be shown

Advantages :
1) Algorithm never consider any non-optimal step
2) Mapping of complete path in vector format with node values
3) pro-active algorithm rather than re-active
4) Consideration of heuristic value, past experiences could be feed in
5) Effective in great circle problem
